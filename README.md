# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict customer churn in the telecommunications industry using a real-world dataset. Churn refers to customers who cancel their subscription, which is a major concern for companies due to lost revenue and increased acquisition costs.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Identify customers at risk of churn  
- Understand key drivers of churn behavior  
- Provide actionable insights to support retention strategies  
- Build and evaluate predictive models using machine learning  

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: [IBM Telco Customer Churn Dataset – via Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)  
- ~7,000 customer records  
- Target: `Churn` (Yes/No)  
- Features include:
  - Demographics: gender, senior citizen, etc.
  - Services: internet, contract type, etc.
  - Charges: monthly and total
  - Tenure and contract details

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 🧼 1. Data Cleaning
- Converted `TotalCharges` from object to numeric  
- Dropped rows with missing values (`NaN`)  
- Removed irrelevant column: `customerID`  
- Encoded target variable: `Churn` → 1 for Yes, 0 for No  

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized churn distribution (26.5% churn rate)  
- Analyzed patterns in tenure, monthly charges, contract type  
- Discovered:
  - Customers with monthly contracts and short tenure churn more  
  - Higher monthly charges also correlated with higher churn  

### 🔄 3. Data Preprocessing (Refine Data)
- Applied one-hot encoding for categorical features  
- Scaled numerical features using `StandardScaler`  
- Split data into training (80%) and test (20%) sets  
- Prepared `X_train`, `X_test`, `y_train`, and `y_test`

## 🧪 4. Model Building & Evaluation

### ✅ Logistic Regression
- Base model, interpretable  
- Accuracy: 80%  
- F1-score (Churn class): **0.61**  
- ROC AUC: 0.836  

### 🌳 Random Forest
- Non-linear, more flexible  
- Accuracy: 79%  
- F1-score (Churn class): 0.56  
- ROC AUC: 0.816  

> Logistic Regression performed better overall in both recall and F1-score for churn detection.

---

## 🔍 5. Cross-Validation (5-Fold)

| Model               | Mean F1 | Std Dev |
|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Logistic Regression | 0.598   | 0.0187  |
| Random Forest       | 0.548   | 0.0178  |

> Logistic Regression showed higher and more consistent performance.

---

## 🛠️ 6. Model Refinement (Hyperparameter Tuning)

### Best Parameters Found:

- **Logistic Regression**: `C=1`, `solver=liblinear`  
- **Random Forest**: `max_depth=10`, `n_estimators=100`, `bootstrap=True`

Final Test Results:

| Model               | Final F1 | Recall (Churn) |
|---------------------|----------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression | **0.61** | **0.57**        |
| Random Forest       | 0.56     | 0.51            |

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Logistic Regression was selected as the final model due to:
- Better recall and F1-score on test data  
- Stable performance during cross-validation  
- Easier to interpret and explain to stakeholders

> With this model, the company can detect over 57% of potential churns and take early retention actions such as discounts, better contract options, or customer service interventions.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Deploy model into CRM system for real-time scoring  
- Visualize churn risk in dashboard (Looker/Tableau)  
- Design marketing campaign based on churn probability
